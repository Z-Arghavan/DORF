Decommissioning and Reuse Ontology (DOR)
===================
The DOR ontology focuses on capturing information related to the decommissioning processes of buildings and the subsequent reuse of building materials, components or even functional layers. It enables stakeholders to plan and execute efficient and sustainable deconstruction and post-consumer practices. The DOR ontology is developed with a trans-perspective vision, recognising the diverse interpretations and perspectives associated with the concept of reusability among different stakeholders. The ontology aims to facilitate a circular future by providing a comprehensive and time-proof circular information exchange solution that acknowledges and incorporates this inherent variability.

The DOR ontology builds upon existing Linked Building Data ontologies such as Building Topology Ontology (BOT), Building Product Ontology (BPO), and Digital Construction Materials (DICM). By extending these established ontologies, DOR ensures compatibility and interoperability with other domain-specific knowledge models and applications.

**Use Cases:**
The DOR ontology serves several important use cases in the built environment domain:
1.	Pre- and Post-Deconstruction Planning: Stakeholders can utilise the ontology to enrich their information models for pre- and post-deconstruction planning. It enables them to capture and organise relevant data, facilitating effective decision-making throughout the deconstruction process.
2.	Circular Databases: The ontology supports the exchange of information with circular databases. By providing a standardised representation of concepts and relationships, it enables seamless integration of data and knowledge sharing among stakeholders in the building deconstruction and material reuse community.
3.	Material Bank Management: DOR supports the processes involved in depositing or assessing the reclaimed components in a material bank. It includes concepts for digital diagnosis, conditions for proper inventory management or remanufacturing of components in a material bank for second life cycle reuse, and documentation requirements to make sure the next reuser has enough information to make the right decisions.

# ðŸ§  SPARQL Queries for Circularity, Reuse, and Regulation in BIM

This repository contains a collection of semantic queries designed to enhance understanding and data extraction for **circular construction**, **reuse potential**, and **regulatory compliance** in (open)BIM workflows.

All queries operate on an ontology developed for circular economy and digital building models, and are written in **SPARQL** using RDF-based vocabularies.

Example SPARQL Queries
==========
A Query to find all entities, which have any legal requirements when it comes to reuse or recycling
