<span class="markdown">
<p>DOR ontology provides a set of classes and their relationships. The classes are organised into different categories. Under the "Actor" category, we have PreDeconstructionAuditor, Manufacturer, MaterialBankAgent, and Designer classes. The "Material Source Type" category includes classes like PrimaryRawMaterial, SecondaryRawMaterial, RecyclableMaterial, NonRenewableMaterial, RenewableMaterial, NonHazardousMaterial, and HazardousMaterial, which are subclasses of MaterialSourceType. The "Circular Potential" category consists of classes such as ReusePotential, RemanufacturingPotential, RecyclingPotential, RepurposingPotential, and DiscardPotential, which are subclasses of CircularPotential. Circular Potential is what defines the end-of-life scenario of a component or product.</p>

<p>"Circular Requirement," which includes classes like Personnel, TrainnedPersonnel, UntrainnedPersonnel, SiteDependency, OnSite, OffSite, Certification, Inspection, InspectionMode, InspectionType, Intervention, Logistics, Exposure, and Legal, represents different requirements related to circularity and enables detailing how a given circular potential will or need to be realised. The "Connection Type" category includes classes like ChemicalConnection, GravitationalConnection, MechanicalConnection, IndirectConnection, DirectConnection, Irreversible_connection, and ReversibleConnection, which are subclasses of ConnectionType. This class is intended to help infer how demounting and disassembling are feasible.</p>

<p>Several object and data properties are used to establish class relationships. These properties include hasCircularPotentialIndicator, hasConstructionDate, hasDecommissioningDate, hasDesignLife, hasEconomicLife, hasServiceLife, hasWasteCode, and also hasCircularPotential, hasCircularRequirement, hasConnectionType amongst others.</p>
